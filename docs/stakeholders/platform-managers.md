# Platform Manager Guide

This guide is for leaders coordinating roadmap, delivery quality, and cross-team execution.

## What the Platform Delivers

- Multi-service healthcare backend with domain-specific bounded contexts.
- Independent micro frontend delivery per business domain.
- AI-assisted triage with human-in-the-loop escalation.
- Infrastructure automation, compliance artifacts, and post-deploy quality gates.

## Team and Responsibility Views

| Team | Primary Surfaces |
|---|---|
| Backend | [src](../../src), [tests/HealthQCopilot.Tests.Unit](../../tests/HealthQCopilot.Tests.Unit), [tests/HealthQCopilot.Tests.Integration](../../tests/HealthQCopilot.Tests.Integration) |
| Frontend | [frontend/apps](../../frontend/apps), [frontend/packages](../../frontend/packages) |
| AI | [src/HealthQCopilot.Agents](../../src/HealthQCopilot.Agents), [frontend/apps/triage-mfe](../../frontend/apps/triage-mfe) |
| DevOps/Platform | [infra](../../infra), [.github/workflows](../../.github/workflows) |

## Release Flow (At a Glance)

1. Pull request enters quality gates in [pr-validation.yml](../../.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml).
2. Service and frontend deploy workflows publish and deploy changed components.
3. Cloud smoke and full E2E checks run in [cloud-e2e-tests.yml](../../.github/workflows/cloud-e2e-tests.yml).
4. If issues are found, use [rollback.yml](../../.github/workflows/rollback.yml).

## Signals to Track Weekly

| Category | Signal | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Delivery | Lead time and failed deployment rate | GitHub Actions run history |
| Quality | PR validation failures by category | [pr-validation.yml](../../.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml) |
| Runtime confidence | Post-deploy smoke/full E2E pass trend | [cloud-e2e-tests.yml](../../.github/workflows/cloud-e2e-tests.yml) |
| Security/compliance | Secret scanning and vulnerability findings | [compliance-check.yml](../../.github/workflows/compliance-check.yml) |

## Platform Review Checklist

- Cross-team dependencies are explicit and scheduled.
- Each release candidate has backend + frontend + cloud E2E evidence.
- Security/compliance checks are green or have approved risk acceptance.
- Rollback path is confirmed for production window.
