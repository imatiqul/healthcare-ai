# Security and Compliance Guide

This guide is for security engineers, compliance leads, and release approvers.

## Security and Compliance Scope

- Shift-left security checks in pull requests and scheduled scans.
- Evidence collection for SOC2/HITRUST, ISO 27001, FedRAMP, and NHS DSP references.
- Secret hygiene and vulnerability management gates.

## Key Security and Compliance Assets

| Area | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| PR gate security checks | [.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml](../../.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml) | Early vulnerability and code quality blocking |
| Scheduled compliance checks | [.github/workflows/compliance-check.yml](../../.github/workflows/compliance-check.yml) | Gitleaks, Trivy, ZAP, k6, Lighthouse compliance posture |
| Secret references | [.github/workflows](../../.github/workflows) | Workflow-level secret usage and required keys |
| Compliance mappings | [docs/compliance](../compliance) | Control mappings and assessment documentation |
| Infrastructure baseline | [infra/bicep](../../infra/bicep) | Security-relevant infrastructure configuration |

## Operational Security Workflow

### 1) Pull request phase

Require passing status from:

- [pr-validation.yml](../../.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml)

### 2) Scheduled or pre-release phase

Run and review:

- [compliance-check.yml](../../.github/workflows/compliance-check.yml)

### 3) Deployment health evidence

Review runtime signals from:

- [deployment-health.yml](../../.github/workflows/deployment-health.yml)

## What to Verify Before Release Approval

1. No active secret leaks in current branch scan output.
2. No unresolved critical vulnerability findings blocking release policy.
3. Relevant compliance mapping docs reflect current architecture state.
4. Required production secrets are present and rotated per policy.
5. Incident response and rollback owners are assigned for release window.

## Compliance References

- [SOC2 and HITRUST Mapping](../compliance/SOC2-HITRUST-Control-Mapping.md)
- [ISO 27001 Mapping](../compliance/ISO27001-Control-Mapping.md)
- [FedRAMP Boundary](../compliance/FedRAMP-Authorization-Boundary.md)
- [NHS DSP Self-Assessment](../compliance/NHS-DSP-Toolkit-Self-Assessment.md)

## Security and Compliance Checklist

- Security scans are passing or formally risk-accepted.
- Secrets are not stored in code and are managed via repository or cloud secret stores.
- Compliance artifacts are updated when architecture or process changes.
- Post-deploy health evidence is archived with release records.
