# Platform Gap Backlog — April 25, 2026

## Scope

This backlog captures the highest-impact platform gaps identified during the latest product review and maps them to execution-ready initiatives.

## Current Reality Snapshot

- Microservice CI/CD reliability recovered after workflow hardening.
- Cloud smoke gate passes consistently.
- Full cloud E2E is still failing on key live API checks, indicating runtime drift and contract misalignment.

## Priority Backlog

| Priority | Gap | Business Impact | Initiative | Owner | Target |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P0 | Full cloud E2E route failures on production gateway | Release confidence blocked; high regression risk | Run targeted service redeploy for identity, agent, scheduling, notification, revenue and rerun cloud E2E | DevOps + Service leads | 24 hours |
| P0 | API contract mismatch between live tests and backend route ownership | False negatives in release gates; noisy triage | Align cloud smoke route probes to current service contracts and publish canonical route map | QA + Backend | 24 hours |
| P1 | Documentation confidence drift ("all complete" narrative vs failing live evidence) | Leadership signal quality reduced | Introduce weekly evidence-driven scorecard from workflow outcomes and route probe SLOs | Product + Platform manager | 1 week |
| P1 | workflow_run gating allows optional frontend deploy evidence | Incomplete release evidence chain | Make frontend deploy required for production cloud E2E release gate where applicable | DevOps | 1 week |
| P1 | Node 20 GitHub Action deprecation warnings | Near-term CI instability risk | Upgrade action versions and validate Node 24 compatibility before enforcement date | DevOps | Before June 2026 |
| P2 | Missing endpoint ownership/contract governance process | Repeated route drift incidents | Add API contract review checklist to PR validation and release readiness checklist | Product + Architecture | 2 weeks |

## Active Execution

- Triggered targeted redeploy run:
  - Workflow: `Microservice CI/CD`
  - Run: `24946993738`
  - Services: `revenue,notification,identity,ai-agent,scheduling`
  - Goal: converge deployed runtime with source-defined endpoint surface.
- Current result:
  - Run `24946993738` failed in `Build + format check` before deploy stages.
  - Primary blocker is repo formatting/charset drift in targeted services (not compile failures).
- Immediate next execution:
  - Merge workflow update that adds manual input `skip_format_check` for emergency redeploys.
  - Rerun `Microservice CI/CD` with `services=revenue,notification,identity,ai-agent,scheduling` and `skip_format_check=true`.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Cloud E2E full suite succeeds for two consecutive main branch runs.
2. All Phase 12, Phase 27, and Phase 41 route probes return non-404/non-405 statuses.
3. Release readiness checklist references live workflow evidence, not static status claims.
4. CI actions no longer emit Node 20 deprecation warnings.

## KPI Tracking (Weekly)

| KPI | Baseline | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Cloud E2E full suite pass rate | Failing on latest run | >= 95% over rolling 10 runs |
| API route probe failure count | 9 failures (latest full suite) | 0 |
| Deployment failure rate | Elevated due route drift | < 5% |
| Mean time to restore release gate | Ad hoc | < 4 hours |

## Dependencies

- Azure Container Apps revision rollout for affected services.
- Gateway/APIM route parity with backend service endpoints.
- QA validation after redeploy completion.

## Notes

- This backlog is intentionally outcome-first; tasks should be closed only when acceptance criteria are verified in CI evidence.
