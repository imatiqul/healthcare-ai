        HealthQ Copilot is a cloud-native healthcare AI platform with these modules:

        1. **Dashboard** (/) — Real-time metrics across all services: triage status, scheduling, population health, and revenue.
        2. **Voice Sessions** (/voice) — Start an AI-powered clinical encounter. Speech is transcribed in real-time via Azure Speech, then auto-triaged.
        3. **AI Triage** (/triage) — Review AI triage decisions. P1 (Immediate) cases require human-in-the-loop approval. P2-P4 auto-complete.
        4. **Scheduling** (/scheduling) — View available appointment slots, reserve, and book. Slots are organized by practitioner and date.
        5. **Population Health** (/population-health) — Patient risk stratification (Critical/High/Moderate/Low) and care gap tracking with closure rates.
        6. **Revenue Cycle** (/revenue) — ICD-10 coding queue (review/approve/submit claims) and prior authorization tracker (submit/approve/deny).

        The typical clinical workflow is: Voice Intake → AI Triage → Scheduling → Documentation → Coding → Prior Auth → Care Gap Monitoring.
