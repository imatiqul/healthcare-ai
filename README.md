# HealthQ Copilot - Cloud Native Healthcare Platform

HealthQ Copilot is a distributed healthcare platform built with .NET microservices, React/Vite micro frontends, and AI-assisted triage workflows.

This repository now uses role-specific documentation so each stakeholder can get to the right context quickly.

## Architecture Snapshot

- Backend runtime: domain services in `src/`, plus API gateway (`src/HealthQCopilot.Gateway`) and GraphQL BFF (`src/HealthQCopilot.BFF`).
- Frontend runtime: shell host plus 7 remotes under `frontend/apps/`.
- Shared frontend contracts: `frontend/packages/mfe-events`, `frontend/packages/graphql-client`, `frontend/packages/web-pubsub-client`.
- Local orchestration: Aspire AppHost (`src/HealthQCopilot.AppHost`) and Docker Compose + Dapr (`docker-compose.yml`, `infra/dapr`).
- Delivery tracks currently present in repo:
  - Azure Container Apps + Static Web Apps pipelines for application deploys.
  - AKS + Helm + ArgoCD/Argo Rollouts infrastructure baseline.

## Quick Start (All Engineers)

### Prerequisites

- .NET 9 SDK + Aspire workload (`dotnet workload install aspire`)
- Docker Desktop (Compose v2)
- Dapr CLI
- Node.js 20+ and pnpm 9+

### Start the Platform Locally

```bash
# Start backend services + infra using Aspire
dotnet run --project src/HealthQCopilot.AppHost
```

```bash
# In a second terminal, start all frontend apps
cd frontend
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

### Run Tests

```bash
# Backend
dotnet test tests/HealthQCopilot.Tests.Unit
dotnet test tests/HealthQCopilot.Tests.Integration

# Frontend
cd frontend
pnpm test
pnpm test:e2e
```
